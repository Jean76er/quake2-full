There are two ways for you to download my mod. One involves forking the modified source code from this link: https://github.com/Jean76er/quake2-full. 
Afterward, you can compile the code in a separate folder. You can then drag the 86.dll file into a separate folder. Then launch the game and relaunch
into the mod folder.

Another way is to download the .dll directly from the link provided in the first method. Then follow the same steps above.

How to play???

Once you jump in the fun will immediately start. Your goal is to survive for as long as you can. Zombies will continue to
spawn in waves. As you go through the waves, powerups will drop that will help you in your survival. This includes laser
sights, health packs, health pills, adrenaline, and many more. You will also notice that you are able to pick a class before
the game starts. This allows you to start with certain items and weapons. The Medic starts out with a health pack and health
pills. The Medic also starts out with a submachine gun. The Rifleman starts out with a Scar assault rifle and a pipebomb. The
Sniper starts out with laser sights and a hunting rifle. Finally, the Support loadout starts out with explosive bullets
and a Combat shotgun. 

How to test???

Well for one you will encounter a lot of enemies that do not normally spawn at the start of the game. But, you can
also, run commands "laser" and "explode" to test and see if these power-ups work. 

Don't let the light die!!! Survive for as long as you can.
